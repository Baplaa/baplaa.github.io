                <h1>Video Games</h1>
                <p><i>A passionate video game enthusiast, I've played countless of video games ever since I was a little kid that it snowballed into a large addiction in my early to mid teens! Nowadays, I don't play that often due to school and schedule conflicts with friends. However, I still have that same torch lit since my early youth anytime I get the chance to play!<br><br>My favourite game has to be Portal 2. I was so enthralled in the universe that I had to play the community mods to further satisfy my obsession with Portal. Luckily, the cake was not a lie.<br><br>I am quite competitive as well.<br><br>Currently in Call of Duty: Warzone, I am amongst the top global less-than-1% players across all platforms. Perhaps playing Call of Duty at a super young age was morally wrong. But hey, gun go pew pew.<br><br>In my senior year of high school, I partipicated in a Provincial eSports tournament with my close friends and we achieved 14th place from 70-something teams. Clear communication and intense solo-hardwork influenced our successful teamwork.<br><br>Pictured above is me (closest to the camera) alongside my team members and coach. Top gap. <br><br>As a bonus, I beat Malenia (with no bleed weapons and summons) and Sigrun (Give Me God of War difficulty in New Game Plus) back to back with no deaths or hits.</i></p>

                <h1>Computer Technician</h1>
                <p><i>Actively being curious of the mechanisms of computers consequently created my deep passion for building computers, messing around with computer tools, and helping family and friends with tech support!<br><br>I clearly understood this passion of mine when I used Cheat Engine when I was around 7 years old to modify certain values in Plants Vs. Zombies in order to unfairly boost my gameplay. It was through this tool that I saw funny looking numbers, strings of letters, and words.<br><br>This was my first introduction to computer language.<br><br>Having been entranced by it, I took an interest in understanding the actual machine itself and its components. This is why I love building computers and compiling parts lists. Having built my own "dream" computer already (and more for friends and clients), I still retain the curiousity and determination to understand new and old technologies to observe the effects on systems and the market.<br><br>Pictured above is my gaming/productivity setup. I thoroughly considered my options for every component and built everything you see in the image.<br><br>As a way to support my personal hobby and to practice my knowledge, I took an I.T. course in high school for 4 years. We were introduced to web development, python programming, video production, and system administration within those 4 years and my experience really validated my passion for web dev and sysadmin! <br><br>Should there be any problems with the WiFi, printing, or general device issues/advice, I am amongst the first opinions sought by my friends and family for assistance. I enjoy taking in their inquiries and actively ensure I meet their requirements, satisfaction, and communication needs.</i></p>
