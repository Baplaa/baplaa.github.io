Nowadays, I don't play that often<br>due to school and schedule conflicts with friends. However, I still have<br>that same torch lit since my early youth anytime I get the chance to play!<br><br>My favourite game has to be Portal 2. I was so enthralled in the universe<br>that I had to play the community mods to further satisfy my obsession<br>with Portal. Luckily, the cake was not a lie.<br><br>I am quite competitive as well.<br><br>Currently in Call of Duty: Warzone, I am amongst the top global<br>less-than-1% players across all platforms. Perhaps playing Call of Duty at<br>a super young age was morally wrong. But hey, gun go pew pew.<br><br>In my senior year of High School, I partipicated in a Pronvincial eSports<br> tournament with my close friends and we achieved 14th place from<br> 70-something teams. Clear communication and intense solo-hardwork<br> influenced our successful teamwork. Top gap. <br><br>As a bonus, I beat Malenia (with no bleed weapons and summons) and<br>Sigrun (Give Me God of War difficulty in New Game Plus) back to back<br>with no deaths or hits.</i></p>
